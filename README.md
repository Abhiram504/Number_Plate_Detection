# Number_Plate_Detection
using python and openCV detection of the Number Plate 
This project is trying to develop a number plate detection software tool. It mainly focuses on detection of the number plate and the chracters that are present inside the number plate region. The detection of the number plate is done by the basic machine learning and supervised learning algorithm K-nearest neighbours (KNN) Alogorithm. KNN is extremly easy to implement in its most basic form and yet performs some of the most complex classification task.
